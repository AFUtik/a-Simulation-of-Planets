# a-Simulation-of-Planets
In order to run this project you need module Pygame how to install this module is written below

‘‘‘shell
pip install pygame
‘‘‘


Next, What you can do in the project you can
create planets and watch how planets behave with gravitation                                                                                                                      




so, you need to know hotkeys:

#Time speed               
Z = Decreases time speed           
X = Increases time speed

#Orbit                         
O = Turn on the orbit and turn off the orbit          


#Creating Planets                         
to create a planet you need to press left mouse button


#Zoom               
to zoom you need spin mouse wheel


If you want change limit of allowed lines just change the variable

or you want to add a planet to the solar system find class Planets and create Planet after that add the variable to the list   

that's example

planet = Planet(x, y, radius, color, mass)                           
if you pass value only on axis x: planet.y_vel = Your_speed or if you pass value only on axis y: planet.x_vel = Your_speed

then add the varible to the list
